# Marketing-Analytics---Customer-Segmentation-in-Python

Ideally, companies need to know their customers so well that they can anticipate their needs. Unlocking these in-depth insights requires segmenting the customers to better serve them. I here run cohort analysis to understand customer trends. Then, I build easy to interpret customer segments. Finally, I prepare the segments created, making them ready for machine learning, and make my segments more powerful with k-means clustering.
